Welcome! I am Fengfei Sun, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at National University of Singapore (NUS). My research lies at the intersection of behavioral and experimental economics, with a particular focus on human-AI interaction and public goods provision. Specifically, I investigate how cognitive biases manifest in large language models and examine cooperative behavior in public goods games through the lens of social preferences. 

Currently, I am working on projects that explore GPT models' potential overconfidence and evaluate the impact of AI-enabled personalized feedback on student outcomes.
