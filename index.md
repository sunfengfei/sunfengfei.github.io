title: "SUN FENGFEI"
---

I am Fengfei Sun, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at National University of Singapore (NUS). My research lies at the intersection of behavioral and experimental economics, with a particular focus on human-AI interaction and public goods provision. Specifically, I investigate how cognitive biases manifest in large language models and examine cooperative behavior in public goods games through the lens of social preferences. 

Here is my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/cv.pdf).
